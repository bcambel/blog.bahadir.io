Dear Paul Graham, Thank you very much
-------------------------------------

Dear Paul,

We have never met before. I don't know you. I don't know what other people think about you. Maybe you're an asshole, a money oriented prick. Seriously I don't know. But I don't think so.

I do know couple of things that you made so far;

- Business: [Y Combinator] (http://ycombinator.com/)

Since 2005 we've funded over 460 startups, including Loopt, Reddit, Clustrix, Wufoo,Scribd, Xobni, Omgpop, Weebly, Songkick, Disqus, Dropbox, ZumoDrive, Justin.tv,Heroku, A Thinking Ape, Machine Zone, Posterous, Airbnb, Heyzap, Cloudkick,DailyBooth, WePay, Bump, Stripe, CarWoo, MixPanel, Cardpool, Optimizely, AeroFS,E la Carte, and Hipmunk.

Wow

- Community: Hackers & Founders - Hacker News

     Even [Amsterdam Hackers & Founders Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Amsterdam-NL/) has 702 members

- [Amazing Essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)  I try to read them again and again.

- A book: [Hackers & Painters](http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340991260&sr=8-1)

I don't need to mention how awesome this book is

You might have some financial gains with these productions. But I do believe there is a greater value in what you have created and achieved so far.

You've created a culture. A community, full of people who are dedicated themselves to solve problems, helping each other on their mission. Most of them might even fail,
but I believe they will stand up and keep on trying again.

A lot of accelerator programs created after Y Combinator. You might have triggered this, I am not so sure. I am not here for the history or who was the first discussion.

I don't know if all of those accelerator programs truly aware of the effects they're making. Those who are failed on their missions shared their experiences candidly.
Open sourced their code base. Entrepreneurs who made exits or earned lots of money with their businesses also invest in other companies, helping other individuals and businesses to be better.

I believe, this is what it's called a **Snowball Effect**.

Paul, you pioneered a culture,

> A Startup Nation whose citizens are all around the world, hackers & founders. Solving problems, making the web and the world a better place, and helping each other without boundries.

You're a great Entrepreneur who revolutionized the startup world.

I hope you're happy, healty, and keep on working passionately, still chasing your dreams.
I wish to meet with you in person. Shake your hand, and thank you personally. I wish that I could achieve %1 of what you've done so far.

Paul, Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,
An Entrepreneur with dreams
