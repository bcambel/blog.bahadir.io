you can download the e-book for free ( 1. I don't earn anything, 2. Yes, it's really free. )

There is another great sentence;

There are also lots of great articles about hiring people.

You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards for the technology. - Steve Jobs from WWD7 1997 talk. See the details here

Great short notes about product pricing and a great link to a post

There is also a marketing part which points out to a article written by Fred Wilson and quoting this
