Why have I failed ?
====================

- **I *knew* everything.**

General
---------

- did not listen people very well. I've heard them but did not actually listen. I kept on talking and talking.
- being an expat and entrepreneur is somewhat crazy when you know you're going to have visa problems. Too much instability in one man's life.
- did not use my time wisely.
- tried to do too much.
- should be less harsh on myself and others.

Business
-----------------

- relationships matter a lot
- did not plan ahead the business.
- *do not write a 100 page business plan* does not mean don't write it at all.
- started working on other ideas and lost focus when business needed the most.
- should take the money when people offer you.

Programming
-------------

- have stuck in maker's obsession.
- wrote too much code. 30% became immediately unnecessary.
- did not prioritize what I should be working next.
- failed to work on Python deliberately.


The Product
-------------

- did not look for a market very well.
- did not able to explain the product in simple terms.
- did not try to sell the product, I've just build it.
- kept 600 people waiting for a demo while having a product.
- Facebook & Twitter do not have quality content.

I am stubborn when I should not be.

I always thought I am smart. I change my mind. I am a fool. A big one.
