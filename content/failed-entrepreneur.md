Why have I failed ?
====================

- **I *knew* everything.**


General
---------

- did not take care myself; emotionally and physically
- did not listen people very well. I've heard them but did not actually listen. I kept on talking and talking.
- being an expat and entrepreneur is somewhat crazy when you know you're going to have visa problems. Too much instability in one man's life.
- did not use my time wisely.
- tried to do too much.
- should be less harsh on myself and others.
- was inconsistent.
	-- I ran 90km in June '12 then in the last 6 months I only ran 30km.

Business
-----------------

- relationships matter a lot
- did not plan ahead the business
- *do not write a 100 page business plan* does not mean don't write it at all
- started working on other ideas and lost focus when business needed the most
- should take the money when a beta user offered to pay

Programming
-------------

- have stuck in maker's obsession
- wrote too much code. 30% became immediately unnecessary
- did not prioritize what I should be working next
- failed to work on Python deliberately


The Product
-------------

- did not look for a market very well
- did not able to explain the product in simple terms
- did not try to sell the product, I've just build it
- kept 600 people waiting for a demo while having a product
- Facebook & Twitter do not have quality content


I am stubborn when I should not be.

I always thought I am smart.

I change my mind.

I am a fool. A big one.
